# ⚙️ Cyber Scripts

A personal collection of cybersecurity-related scripts I’ve written to automate enumeration or brute forcing, and enhance my home lab operations.

## 🧠 What’s Inside

This repo includes scripts written in:
- 🐍 Python
- 🐚 Bash
- 📜 PowerShell

Each one is designed to save time, reduce friction, or give me an edge during security testing and lab work.

## 🧰 Sample Script Types
- 🔍 Port scanners and network mappers
- 🧠 VPN status + auto-reconnect
- 📡 Log analyzers (firewall, system logs)
- 🔐 File integrity checkers
- ☁️ Quick upload/download tools (FTP, SCP)
- 👀 OSINT gathering helpers

## 📁 Structure (Coming Soon)
Each script will include:
- Description of its purpose
- How to run it
- Required permissions (if any)
- Future ideas for enhancements

## 🚀 Why This Repo Exists

These are the scripts I reach for when I’m working in the trenches of my lab. Some are small one-liners, others are full-on utility scripts, but every one of them solves a real problem I’ve faced.
